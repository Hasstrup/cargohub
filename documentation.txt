Hi there. Thanks for the opportunity to be a part of this challenge. 
Cargo hub is an application for folks to peruse through data from the 
UN in ways that are easy to comprehend and assimilate. 

Technologies Used
Ruby on Rails
Rspec
GraphQL
React

Getting Started
- run  bundle install 
- rake db:setup
- rails db:migrate
- You should get the built client, so you can run rails s 
  and navigate to the index page, to see the app working :)

The application is hosted online at https://cargohub.herokuapp.com 

Thank you again!
